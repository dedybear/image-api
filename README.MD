# Image API

Attempting to be concious of time, I tried to make this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) do as much as I could. I did include enough basic testing to illustrate that I know how to bring Jest in for Vanilla JS. 

Thank you for your time, I look forward to speaking further.

## Places I would go from here

1. I would complete testing.  I aim for 80% coverage for unit tests, and I would leverage DataProviders to expand validation from those tests.
2. I would update the modal to be much more user friendly.  Verify many more view ports, make sure that the background is clickable and would close the modal, etc...
3. I would also go through and document the Why's of certain choices that were made. I am incredibly pro documentation, but I chose in this instance to focus my time on coding this out.
